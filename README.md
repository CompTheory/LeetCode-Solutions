# ⭐ LeetCode Solutions – Clean, Efficient, and Well-Explained Code

 This repository contains my curated solutions to LeetCode problems, written with a focus on:  
🔹Clean and readable code  
🔹Optimal time and space complexity  
🔹Clear explanations and thought process  
🔹Common patterns used in coding interviews  
    (two pointers, sliding window, binary search, DFS/BFS, DP, greedy, heap, etc.)

The goal of this repo is to improve problem-solving skills while building a solid reference for coding interviews, FAANG preparation, and competitive programming.

### 📌 What You’ll Find Here  
🔹Python implementations for LeetCode problems  
🔹Structured folders by topic (Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, DP…)  
🔹Comments explaining intuition + algorithm  
🔹Multiple solutions where helpful (brute force → optimized)

### 🎯 Purpose  
This repo serves as:  
🔹A personal learning log  
🔹A resource for others preparing for coding interviews  
🔹A demonstration of algorithmic thinking and coding style
